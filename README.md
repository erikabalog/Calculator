JavaScript Calculator Project

This is a simple JavaScript calculator project that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface to input numbers and operators and displays the result on the screen.

Open the index.html file in your web browser to access the calculator.

Use the following buttons to perform calculations:
Numbers (0-9) buttons: Click on these buttons to input the numbers you want to calculate.

Equals (=) button: Click on this button to display the result of the calculation on the screen.
